Taskifier...

...is a simple tool for managing daily todos. The V in the name indicates
that it is written in good old dirty Visual Basic.NET. A C# sharp version
(TaskifierC) will be implemented after the V version. And finally there
might be versions for Mac OS (TaskifierX) and iOS (Taskifier?!?).

Right now Taskifier is in alpha status and not to be used in a production
anvironment. A version X.Y with X <= 1 will indicate that it is kind of
stable though. But this will take a few more hours/days/months/years.
